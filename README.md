# Predicting Student Dropout Risk in a University

### Overview
A university is concerned about the increasing number of students dropping out before completing their degrees. The academic board has collected data about students’ academic, personal, and socio-economic backgrounds. They want to use machine learning to predict whether a student is at risk of dropping out, so that proactive intervention can be made.
